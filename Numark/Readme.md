This is the firmware to be used in case your Numerk is not detected by windows , or it is appearing as tusb3200 om control panel , this happens because the 24c64 firmware is corrupted  , flashing this binary file will make windows recognize it again as N4 .
In case of detection but no audio then it is the MCU located in the big board attached to the decks . That formware must be requested to support of numark in case your warranty as already expired .
